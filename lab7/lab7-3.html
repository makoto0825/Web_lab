        <h2 class="big">Looking for a unique gift?</h2>
        <p>
          Town Hall has the answer. For only $100, you can get a book of tickets
          for all of the remaining speakers. And the bargain includes a second
          book of tickets for a companion.
        </p>
        <p>
          　　　　Or, for $50, you can give yourself the gift of our speakers,
          and still get an extra ticket for a companion, but for just one of the
          events.
        </p>
        <p>　　　　See you show at the next show?</p>
        <p>

          information.
